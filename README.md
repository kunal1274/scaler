Scaler Problems
We are making this Notes to keep the DSA topic crisp and clear. The aim is to keep things simple and elegant.

We can divide the DSA into following sections - 
On a very high level if you learn the following four techniques then thing will get easier to solve : 
[ LOOPS , HASHMAP , RECURSION and LINKED LIST ]

The Core data structures are : 
[ ARRAYS , HASHMAP , LINKED LIST ] 

The Core Algorithms are : 
[ CARRY FORWARD , SLIDING WINDOW , PREFIX/SUFFIX SUM/MAX , BIT MANIPULATION, RECURSIONS , USING LINKED LIST IDEA on Stacks, Trees, Tries , Queue , Heaps etc. , GREEDY ALGO ,
BACKTRACKING , DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING , GRAPHS ] 

1. Fundamentals of Programming Language [ Single Liner - Focus on Syntax ] 
   - It could be any programming language - python or Java or Javascript or C# or php etc. 
   - basic data types : int, str , bool , 1d array, 2d array , hashmap , hashset , tuple ( if any )
   - basic operations : +,-,*,/,%,power, and , or , xor , not
   - basic loops : for, while , do while ( if any ) 
2. DSA 1 [ Single Liner - Focus on Loops ] 
   - Time and Space complexity Calculation
   - Operation : Loops implementation on
     - Data Structures : Arrays , Subarrays , 2d matrix , Subsets , Subsequences
     - Algo : Prefix sum/max/min , Suffix sum/max/min , Carry forward, Sliding window , Bit Manipulation
3. DSA 2 [ Single Liner - Focus on  Hashmap and Recursions ]
   - Hashmap, hashsets
   - Recursions Basic
   - sorting
   - searching
4. DSA 3 [ Single Liner - Focus on Linked List and its derived data structures ]
   - Linked List , Double Linked List , Use of Recursions
   - Stacks , Queues , Deque , Heaps
5. DSA 4 [ Single Liner - Focus on Recursions ]
    - Trees , Tries
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Backtracking
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Graphs
6. DSA 5 [ Single Liner - Will Update Later ]
